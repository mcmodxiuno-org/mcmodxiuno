# How to Choose Between [Flashback](/en/mod/flashback.md) and [ReplayMod](/en/mod/replaymod.md)?

::: tip

Personal opinion, for reference only

:::

[Flashback](/en/mod/flashback.md) and [ReplayMod](/en/mod/replaymod.md) are two mods I have used. Before Minecraft 1.21, only [ReplayMod](/en/mod/replaymod.md) dominated the scene. It wasn't until version 1.21 that [Flashback](/en/mod/flashback.md) emerged, with features more akin to video editing software like Premiere Pro and DaVinci Resolve.

## Drawbacks

[ReplayMod](/en/mod/replaymod.md) used to have a lot of drawbacks, such as: no synchronized audio in exports, poor optimization, huge disk space usage, and many other issues that made me give up on [ReplayMod](/en/mod/replaymod.md).

Of course, [Flashback](/en/mod/flashback.md) is not without its flaws either, for example: no player perspective feature, and the built-in FFMPEG in the mod takes up a lot of disk space.

## Features

Next, let's talk about the unique features of these two mods.

### [ReplayMod](/en/mod/replaymod.md)

* Panorama video
* Player perspective
* Green screen video

### [Flashback](/en/mod/flashback.md)

* Recordings take up little disk space
* Powerful features
* Can hide GUI during rendering
* Robust functionality

## Conclusion

How to choose between these two mods? Here is a suggestion:
- If you are playing Minecraft 1.21 or above with Java 21 or above, it is recommended to abandon [ReplayMod](/en/mod/replaymod.md) and embrace [Flashback](/en/mod/flashback.md).

- If you are playing Minecraft below 1.21 with Java below 17, it is best not to consider [Flashback](/en/mod/flashback.md); using [ReplayMod](/en/mod/replaymod.md) is the safest choice.
